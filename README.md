# Human Emotion Predictor App

## Overview

The **Human Emotion Predictor App** is a machine learning application that predicts human emotions based on input sentences. The app can classify emotions into six categories: **Sadness**, **Joy**,
**Fear**, **Love**, **Anger**, and **Surprise**. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models, this app provides users with insights into the emotional 
context of their input text.

## Features

- Predicts one of six emotions from user-provided sentences.
- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
- Visualizations of data and model performance.
- Interactive word clouds to explore emotional vocabulary.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **Machine Learning & NLP**:
  - Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - WordCloud

- **Web Framework**:
  - Streamlit

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-emotion-predictor.git
   cd human-emotion-predictor

Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Required Packages:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the Human Emotion Predictor App, execute the following command in your terminal:
bash
streamlit run app.py

Once the app is running, you can enter a sentence in the input box, and the model will predict the corresponding emotion.

Workflow

Data Preparation:
The dataset is preprocessed using techniques such as stemming and encoding of labels.
Text data is converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding and padded to ensure uniform input size.

Model Training:
A Sequential model is built using Keras, incorporating layers such as Embedding, LSTM, Dense, and Dropout.
Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting during training.

Prediction:
The trained model is used to predict emotions based on user input.
The predictions are then displayed in the user interface.

Visualization:
Data visualizations, including word clouds and performance metrics, are generated to enhance user understanding.
